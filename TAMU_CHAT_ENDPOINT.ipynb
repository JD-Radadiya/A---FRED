It\\'s thrilling to witness our \\nfaculty creatively integrating artificial intelligence into their classrooms, making education more \\nengaging, personalized, and effective. \\n \\nLet me walk you through some of the most exciting projects our educators are leading: \\nEmpowering Researchers with AI \\nRafael Landaverde is breaking down barriers for novice researchers. His project integrates \\npowerful AI tools like Claude 3.5, ChatGPT, and LitMaps to help master\\'s and doctoral students \\nrefine their research questions and streamline complex processes. Imagine the potential when \\nresearch becomes more intuitive and accessible! \\nResponsible AI Use in Business \\nLisa Troy is proactively addressing AI misuse by incorporating contextual resources into \\nbusiness education using innovative platforms such as Cartedo. Her approach not only boosts \\nstudent engagement with interactive tools like \"Live Chat\" but also promotes informed and \\nresponsible use of AI. \\nRevolutionizing Assessment Creation \\nRobert Hardin is tackling a common challenge for educators—creating formative assessments. \\nBy leveraging prompt engineering with AI technologies like Claude 3.5 and ChatGPT, Robert\\'s \\nproject generates comprehensive assessment questions directly from lectures and textbooks. \\nThis dramatically cuts down faculty workload and enhances teaching effectiveness. \\nDocumenting Real AI Success Stories \\nCindy Raisor is capturing the real-world impact of AI in education through detailed case studies. \\nBy documenting faculty experiences with tools such as NotebookLM, Claude 3.5, and ChatGPT, \\nCindy\\'s project provides practical, relatable examples that inspire and guide other educators. \\nPersonalized AI Feedback \\nJohn Williams is pioneering adaptive feedback systems powered by AI, helping students \\ncontinuously improve. His project dynamically tracks student performance trends using tools like \\nClaude 3.5 and ChatGPT, offering personalized feedback that evolves throughout the semester. \\nModernizing Public Health Education \\nBangning Zhang is bringing public health education into the future. Using advanced AI tools like \\nChatGPT and Google Gemini, Bangning integrates real-world, AI-generated examples into \\ncourse materials. This approach refreshes traditional teaching methods, making lessons \\nimmediately relevant and engaging for students. \\n \\nOur faculty\\'s groundbreaking work is supported by Texas A&M\\'s Technology Services team, who \\nhave provided exclusive beta access to advanced AI technologies. This collaborative spirit \\nunderscores our university\\'s dedication to leading innovation in educational technology. \\nTeamwork makes the dream work. What\\'s Next? \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThese innovative projects showcase the transformative power of AI in higher education and hint \\nat what\\'s possible on a broader scale. We\\'re excited to see these advancements become a \\nstandard part of education everywhere. Which AI project resonates with you the most? How \\ncould you see AI shaping your teaching methods or educational experiences? Do you have \\ninnovative ideas in mind? Join with the next cohort for the ITF program!'},\n",

      "- Selective Service: males ages 18–25 are typically asked to acknowledge registration (or automatic registration).\n",
      "- Voter registration: you can register to vote or update your voter registration at the same time by completing the voter section included with the form.\n",
